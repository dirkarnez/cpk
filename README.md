cpk
===
**Work in progress**  

A real stupid C/C++ package manager for own studying (intended not to use other C++ package managers available).  
**And YES! `cpk` sounds exactly like swearing in Cantonese-mixing-English. hahaha :P**

### Convention / Rules / Targets
1. `cpk` focuses on providing **prebuilt libraries** for CMake projects
2. `cpk` must be portable (no registry, no system directory access, no `%PATH%` modifying, no `pkg-config`, no crazy path-searching)
    - store the fetched C++ packages in its directory instead of %USERPROFILE% or `~`
3. `cpk` must support different compilers
    - For Windows, mingw and MSVC are a must. 
4. `TARGET_COMPILER` should be well-defined and consistent, with compiler version
5. `TARGET_TAG` should stick to the original versioning practice (eg. some may version "v2.5.1", some may version "2.5.1")
6. `TARGET_LIBRARY` is the library name, it should follow the original name
7. There should be a centralized repository store the information of prebuilt libraries (exactly like `npm`)
8. The creation of prebuilt libraries and their repository should be automated in GitHub action and repository template (`gcc -dumpversion` gets "8.1.0")
9. `cpk` and the supporting library repositories should also support listing include paths for easier development in VSCode
10. For C/C++ projects using `cpk`, there should not be any configuration files needed - `cpk` should only depend on (read / write) explicit `cmake` file complying project onfiguration (`find_package` in `CMakeLists.txt`)
11. `cpk` should leave room for modifying third-party libraries (for example: editing original `CMakeLists.txt` and may / may not submit PR in a **fork repo** and rebuilding prebuilts, including ad-hoc /private redirection of libraries
13. `cpk` should resolve dependency-related issues like nested dependency
14. `cpk` should give hints (using CMake macros?) on further setup for the projects using the installed libraries
15. `cpk` should be unobtrusive, play well with unsupported / local libraries - `cpk` should have a dedicated folder for its CMake modules fetching and configuration (use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`?)

### How to use `cpk` in C/C++ project
1. Prerequisites for C/C++ setup (also these compiler, git, cmake, `cpk` are in `%PATH%`)
2. Having `cmake/modules/.gitkeep` - `cpk` assumes `cmake/cpk_modules` exists (or warn) and expect to overwrite the FindXXX.cmake if applicable
3. `cpk` assumes there are version constraints (exact or ranged, **`master` should not be supported**)
